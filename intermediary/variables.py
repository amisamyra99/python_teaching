#What is variables
# variables are objects .they are used to
# refers to a box in our computer memory
# they contains a value,and we can access this
# value by using the variable name
# All the variables are actually an object of a class depending upon the value.

# variables names
# 1 dont start with a digit
# but you can start with a letter(upper or lower case) or an underscore
# myVar, MyVar, _myVar, MyVar123 are valid variable names, but m*var, my-var, 1myVar are invalid variable names.

# int
import numpy as np
a = 4
type(a)

# string
a = "my name"
type(a)

# boolean
statement = True
type(statement())

# remarque
# Unlike other programming languages like C# or Java, Python is a dynamically-typed language,
# which means you don't need to declare a type of a variable.
# The type will be assigned dynamically based on the assigned value.
# you can have access to the adress of this object by using the function
# then python optimize your computer memory for variables with same value

id(a)

# important to notice
# mutilple variable with the same id will have the same id

b = "hello"
id(b)
c = b
id(c)
d = "hello"
id(d)

# Multiple variable assignment
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
print("x: ", x, "y: ", y, "z: ", z)
x, y, z = 10, 'Hello', True

# x = 10, y = 'Hello', z = True
# variables operation
# lets go with an example
# suppose you're working in a superMrket and store your daily selling
# and at the end the day,they ask differents information

tomatoes = 100
cleaning_stuff = 200
water = 123.23

total1 = tomatoes+cleaning_stuff+water
print(total1)

# still working in a superMarket and now you have to store
# the employers who works this days

employer = " Ami Samyra"
emp2 = "Martin Sanou"
emp3 = "Mr sanfo"


print("todays employers list:", employer, emp2, emp3)

# another way is to use multiple assignment that we use before
employer, emp2, emp3 = " Ami Samyra", "Martin Sanou"

print("todays employers list:", employer, emp2, emp3)

type(emp3)

# third solution
emps = " Ami Samyra,"+"Martin Sanou,"+"Mr sanfo."
print(emps)

Exercise 3:
    you're' a worker at Ecobank and your boss 
    ask you to help him to manage his clients
    1-create a list containing 4 name of clients
    clients=['Ami','Jean','Paul','Max']
    2-your boss forget one name and ask you to add to
    the list ==> 'Simon'
    
   3- delete Paul from the list 
   4-here is another list 
   list2=["Frank","Mark","Ron","Hermione"]
   add this to your first list "clients"
   
   5-how many clients do you have in you list
