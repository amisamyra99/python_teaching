"""
python datatype which don't care about order
instead of order ,it's work with a system of key-value '

"""
# we use curly bracket to create a dictionary we have to
# precise the key in the left side of ":" and in the right
# side we give the value
# example
mark = {"English": 12, "German": 12, "Math": 12, "Physics": 12, }

"""
for the first example we chose to work with a string as a key
but we have to know that 
The key should be unique and an immutable object. 
A number, string or tuple can be used as key.

"""

# example
"""
what is an immutable object ?
It is an object that can be modify after is creation
as string ,int and tuples
the opposite of immutable is mutable object
dictionnary ,list ...

"""
# example
# empty dictionary
"""
2 way to create a dictionnary with 
*curly bracket an second is with dict

Dictionary is an unordered collection, so a value cannot be accessed using an index; instead,
 a key must be specified in the square brackets, as shown below.

you can also use get to avoid raising an error when the value don't exist
